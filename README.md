# Python Type Conversion Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates basic type conversion operations in Python. The notebook covers how to convert between different types such as strings, integers, and floats, with examples and explanations.

## Contents

1. **String to Integer Conversion**:
    - Convert a string representation of a number (e.g., `'123'`) into an integer using `int()`.
    - Display the result and verify the type using `type()`.

2. **Float to Integer Conversion**:
    - Convert a float (e.g., `12.34`) to an integer using `int()`.
    - Observe how Python handles the decimal part when converting from float to integer.

3. **Integer to Float Conversion**:
    - Convert an integer (e.g., `5`) to a float using `float()`.
    - Verify the result and its type using `print()` and `type()`.

4. **Explanation of Type Casting**:
    - Demonstrates the importance of type casting and how it is handled in Python.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to observe the outputs for each type conversion operation.
